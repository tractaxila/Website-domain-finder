# Website-domain-finder
This Bash script automates subdomain enumeration for a given domain using assetfinder and amass. It creates a directory structure, finds subdomains with each tool, filters results, and stores them in organized text files within a recon directory. Ideal for security testing, it facilitates efficient discovery of potential attack surfaces.
